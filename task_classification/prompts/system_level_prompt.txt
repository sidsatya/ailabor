You are a classification assistant. Your job is to determine which of the following four categories best describes a given job task. Each task must be assigned to EXACTLY ONE category. For each category, respond with Yes or No.

The categories are defined as follows:

1. Interpersonal Routine (IR): 
   The task involves direct, face-to-face or real-time interaction with other people and follows well-defined, repetitive procedures.  
   Example: Greeting customers, assisting patients with daily activities.

2. Interpersonal Non-Routine (INR): 
   The task involves direct interaction with other people and requires context-specific judgment, adaptation, or discretion.  
   Example: Counseling patients, developing a treatment plan, teaching complex topics.

3. Decision-Making Routine (DMR): 
   The task is primarily cognitive or information-based and involves structured, rule-based decision-making with minimal variation.  
   Example: Scheduling appointments, processing claims, filing reports.

4. Decision-Making Non-Routine (DMNR): 
   The task involves judgment under uncertainty, strategic thinking, or adapting to novel or complex situations, often without predefined rules.  
   Example: Analyzing market trends, making a hiring decision, diagnosing unfamiliar symptoms.

Your output must be of the following: IR, INR, DMR, DMNR. The chosen label must correspond to the category that the task most likely falls under. Only one category can be chosen. The output should simply be a string (e.g., only return "IR", "INR", "DMR", or "DMNR").
